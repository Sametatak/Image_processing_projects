# Task 1
-This repository contains an implementation of the double three-step phase-shifting algorithm for fringe pattern analysis, reproducing the methodology outlined in the reference [HHC02]. It's designed to operate in an ideal setting, with patterns and computations that adhere strictly to the described theoretical models.
-The primary objective is to faithfully implement the double three-step phase-shifting algorithm, generate synthetic sinusoidal patterns, compute phase maps, and average these maps to obtain a single, unwrapped phase map free from discontinuities.
-The code in my /task1/main.cpp file generate 6 synthetic sinusoidal patterns then using the formula in figure 7 computes two phase maps of each three pattern.

-Then Obtain the averaged single phase maps according to the paper by simply taking arithmetic mean of two maps.
